// My cool crafty guess game.  aka "A Festival of Console Logs!"



// (Game Notes:  Game is not yet complete and the following need to be added)
//  - hide the answers but keep the hint visible
//  - on button press call the random index function and generate another hidden answer
//  - remove the keypresses outside of the input box
//  - total the wins and losses
//  - hide the congratulatory message
//  - update the congratulatory message



// Game Variables (wip)

        var wins = 0;  // the number of times the user guesses correctly

        var loses = 0;  // the number of times the user guesses incorrectly

        var initKeyPress = Math.floor(Math.random()*4); // the inital key press to get the game started

        var playerKeyPress; // all of the keypresses the player presses during a single guess. This needs to be cleared out after a successfull guess or player has run out of attempts.

        var gameRound; // may not be needed, but, this variable will hold the current game round index (is this round 1, 2, 3 ,4 etc)

        //var pctname = gameAnswer0.pctname;

        //var pctpic = gameAnswers[0].pctpic;

        //initKeyPress = var randomGameAnswers = gameAnswers[compIndexItem].pctname;

        //var randomGameAnswers = gameAnswers[compIndexItem].pctname;

        // var winsUpdate = document.getElementById("wins")

        // winsUpdate.innerHTML = wins;

**************************************

the answers that should be randomly selected by index by the game, this version tries to create and array with objects in it, didn't seem to work so I created a series of individual objects that were named x1, x2, x3 etc.  It was painful. so glad I don't have to use that idea. 

MY IDEA ABOUT OBJECTS IN AN ARRAY WAS ACTUALLY VALID!  WOOOOHOOO, WON'T HE DO IT! THANKS STERLING!  

I was using a () instead of a [] when referencing each index item. smh. 
I also had a mix of lower and upper case object properties from copying and pasting the wrong thing.

            pctDesc:"The mica shift is a very simple technique that yields incredible results. It works with polymer clay that has mica in it,  first you align the mica particles in the clay and later disturb them to produce very interesting effects. My favorite effect is the 3D optical illusion that you get when you use a stamp; the clay appears to have depth, while being completely flat. It's a very interesting optical illusion that is fun both make and watch.",

Judith Skinner is a hero to literally countless of clayers for her incredible discovery - how to use the pasta machine to easily create ramped color gradients. That's what a Skinner Blend is - using the pasta machine to produce a ramped or smooth color transition gradient. In the illustration to the right, that first drawing with the blue and white triangles may help you understand why the Skinner blend technique works the way it does. The ratio of the two colors as you go from left to right changes.",

Polymer clay lends itself perfectly to creating patterns from layers of oven-bake clay, manipulating them and removing slices. Layers of clay are manipulated with rubber stamps, texture sheets, needle tools, balls of clay strategically placed under the stack and found objects. Gold, silver or copper leaf may be added between the layers of clay for some very interesting results.",

The first time I saw it done, was around 10 years ago by well known polymer clay artist Lisa Pavelka. It is one of those techniques that is in-the-commons and is done and taught by many people in our niche. The Sutton Slice is one of those techniques that is simple in theory, but can be tricky to do well. ",

Marble colours together, black with white, white with black (there is a difference) and white with tonal variations of one colour for different outcomes. There’s so much you can do once you have this skill perfected – which won’t take you long. The most important thing to remember when you’re marbling clay is not to over mix the colours. You don’t want to mix it into one colour! You do need a little mixing to create the streaks and gradients though so there’s a bit of trial and error at play here. Best thing to do? Pick up your clay and start experimenting!",
